Machine Learning Quarter 1 Project

This project analyzes the effectiveness of various classification and attribute selection methods in tandem.
We tested the following attribute selection algorithms: Information Gain, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), J48 (learner-based), and OneR.
We tested the following classification models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, J48 (learner-based), and RandomTree (a variant of the standard decision tree algorithm).
We evaluated our models on the following dataset: 
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/estimates-of-lake-nitrogen-phosphorus-and-chlorophyll-a-concentrations-to-characterize-har

This dataset focuses on characteristics and health metrics of lakes around the United States. We aimed to predict the natural logarithm of the chlorophyll-a class.

This project was co-authored by Nikhil Alladi, Peter Kisslev, and Jacob Dipasupil.
